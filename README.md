# mobu-elm

A web application to manage participants and timer for mob-programming!

This project currently is Just an Elm clone of [TypeScript & React](https://github.com/mobu-of-the-world/mobu), but this will overtake it in near future!

## How to build `index.html`

```console
$ elm make src/Main.elm
Success!

    Main ───> index.html
```
